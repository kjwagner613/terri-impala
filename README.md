# **Impala Streamer**  
A sovereign, personal media player for **impala.kevin-wagner.org**.  
Designed for clarity, predictability, and zero hidden side‑effects.

Impala Streamer is a static frontend + a private signer API.  
Each instance maintains its own **auth session**, **preferences**, and **playlist storage**, ensuring isolation between deployments.

# **Features**

### **Authentication**
- Dedicated sign‑in page  
- Local session storage with expiry  
- Automatic redirect when session is missing or invalid  

### **Playback**
- Audio + video support  
- Built‑in playlists  
- Custom playlists  
- Local library override via JSON manifest  
- Persistent playback state  

### **Preferences**
- Color palettes  
- Custom player message  
- Custom medallion image  
- Local audio/video root directories  
- Local library JSON (optional)  

### **Diagnostics**
A built‑in diagnostics system provides:

- Player state snapshot  
- Playlist registry overview  
- Local storage usage + warnings  
- Media resolver debug info  
- Rolling error log  
- Last storage write status  

Diagnostics never interferes with playback.

# **Minimal Setup**

1. Serve the root folder as a static site  
   (Five Server, Python `http.server`, nginx, etc.)
2. In `app-config.js`, set:
   ```js
   apiBaseUrl: "https://your-signer-api"
   ```
   Or open **Settings -> Cloud Library Connection** and enter the signer API URL for this browser.
   The user's S4 bucket, endpoint, region, and credentials belong on the signer service as server environment variables; do not put S4 access keys in browser config or local storage.

   For a separate cloned/static instance, set `instanceStorageId` in `app-config.js` to a stable short value such as `artistPilot` or `piDemo`. Impala appends it to `playlistStoragePrefix` so browser-local preferences, playlists, auth sessions, diagnostics, and playback state do not overlap with other Impala instances on the same browser.

   Each browser installation creates a local Instance ID in Settings. It is included in backups and sent as a request header so future services can distinguish one Impala installation from another without exposing S4 credentials.
3. Open `signin.html` and authenticate.  
4. You will be redirected to `index.html` after sign‑in.

# **Hotkeys (Player View)**

- **S** — Star/unstar current track  
- **A** — Add starred tracks to an existing playlist  
- **N** — Create new playlist from starred tracks  
- **M** — Open manage view in song editor  
- **C** — Clear all starred tracks  
- **H** or **?** — Show hotkey help  

---

# **Local Library JSON (Optional)**

You may override built‑in playlists by providing a JSON manifest in **Preferences → Local Library JSON**.

Supported structure:

```json
{
  "audio": [ ... ],
  "video": [ ... ]
}
```

If present, Impala Streamer uses local entries for that mode.  
If empty or invalid, it falls back to built‑ins.

---

# **Diagnostics (Optional but Recommended)**

Open `diagnostics.html` to view:

- current player snapshot  
- playlist registry counts  
- storage usage  
- media resolver details  
- error log  

Snapshots are published automatically while the player is open.

---

# **Signer Service (Heroku)**

The signer API handles:

- user authentication  
- signed S4 URLs for media  
- optional video bucket separation  
- fast manifest generation  

Environment variables (Heroku config vars):

- `SESSION_SECRET`  
- `S4_BUCKET`  
- `S4_VIDEO_BUCKET` (optional)  
- `S4_ACCESS_KEY_ID`  
- `S4_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`  
- `ALLOWED_USERS_JSON`  

Deploy signer only:

```bash
git subtree push --prefix services/heroku-signer heroku main
```

Or, if your Heroku app uses `master`:

```bash
git subtree push --prefix services/heroku-signer heroku master
```

---

# **Live Stream Service (Heroku)**

The live stream control API is isolated under `services/heroku-live-stream`.
It uses the same signed auth session format as the signer service, but it does not touch S4 or core playback.

Environment variables:

- `SESSION_SECRET` (must match the signer service so existing sessions verify)
- `ALLOWED_USERS_JSON` (same usernames; admin users can start/stop sessions)
- `CORS_ORIGINS`
- `LIVE_STREAM_ENABLED` (set `true` only when testing live stream control sessions)

Frontend configuration:

```js
liveStreamApiBaseUrl: "https://your-live-stream-service.herokuapp.com"
```

Deploy live stream service only:

```bash
git subtree push --prefix services/heroku-live-stream heroku-live main
```

---

# **Security Quick Checks**

- No S4 credentials live in the frontend.  
- Keep `CORS_ORIGINS` tight.  
- Keep signed URL TTL short (10–30 minutes).  
- Keep token TTL reasonable.  
- Rotate secrets immediately if exposed.  

Verify nothing sensitive is committed:

```bash
git grep -nE "S4_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=|SESSION_SECRET=" -- . \
  ":(exclude)services/heroku-signer/.env.example"
```

# **Philosophy**

Impala Streamer is built around:

- **Sovereignty** — your media, your rules  
- **Predictability** — no hidden behavior  
- **Local-first** — browser storage, local roots, local JSON  
- **Zero friction** — clean UI, intentional interactions  
- **Transparency** — diagnostics for everything
